10/17/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",PA,177XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,10/20/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2163100

2/28/2017,Credit card,,Other fee,,"Was a happy XXXX card member for years, in late XX/XX/2016 XXXX converted the card portfolio to Barclaycard ( XXXX ). We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. 
I feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years.

1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). 

2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. 

3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. 

4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. 

5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. 

The company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. 

Facts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. 
2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. 
4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. 
5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons.

6/28/2016,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I went through a divorce several years ago and requested a home loan modification through Bank of America. Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and "" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been "" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. 

Lastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it!

It has been difficult for me to find my past due balance. I missed a regular monthly payment. When I attempted to make a payment to try to get caught up I could not find my past due balance. My printed statement listed a past due balance, but it did not list a payment that I had made prior to the statement being generated. My online account did not list a past due balance at all. It only told me that I had a regular monthly payment due. It also did not list any late fees or other fees of any kind. I then received a letter stating that my mortgage was now in default. This confused me even more because neither my statement or online account had any information about my loan being in default. Also, I did n't think my loan could be in default because I was approximately 30 days past due. I called SPS. When I called and entered in my account information, I was greeted by an audio recording stating that I had a regular monthly payment due. The recording made no reference to a past due balance or to my loan being in default or to any fees that may be due. I selected the option to speak with a representative. Prior to speaking with a representative I was greeted by another recording stating that I was about to speak with a "" debt collector '' and that any information given would be used in order to "" collect on a debt ''. At this point I felt SPS was deliberately trying to confuse and intimidate me. Is SPS a mortgage loan servicer or a debt collector? Is my account in default or past due? What is my past due balance? The rep I spoke with was polite, but not helpful. I did finally get my current past due balance. However, I was threatened with "" legal action '' if my account was not made current with in 6 days. I was not given an answer to why my online account does not reflect my past due balance, is my loan in default or past due, why do I have to pay {$15.00} to make an online payment, why did my interest rate go up. Furthermore, I was given unclear answers about what kind of a company SPS is ( mortgage loan servicer or debt collector ), why do they use intimidating language both in documents and over the phone, is SPS purposefully trying to confuse me.

1/10/2017,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Can't repay my loan,Can't get flexible payment options,"I was dropped from my income based repayment plan by FedLoan servicing in XXXX of 2016. they contacted me by email but never tried to call me, even after being delinquent for over 2 months, ( while they had my current phone number on file ). When I checked my loans myself, I found statements saying I needed to pay over XXXX dollars of standard repayments that had accrued in order to remove the delinquency ( i believe this is predatory and illegal ). Instead I contacted an Ombudsman from the XXXX. She instructed me to declare forbearance ( which Fedloan services did not tell me was an option. FedLoan services told me I had to pay the full 2 months payments on a standard repayment plan I was now on, and continue to pay that amount until a new IBR payment plan was processed. this sounded fraudulent so I contacted a XXXX ombudsman. 

After the Ombudsman talked with the student loan company, both parties ( lender and ombudsman ) told me on XXXX XXXX that I would be entered into forbearance and a new loan document asking me to pay a nominal {$5.00} fee would be sent to me. After this fee is payed, I was told I would enter my repayment plan. I was assured my application was in their system and being processed, and Fedloan services person even confirmed they had my income verification documents showing I made around {$16000.00}, and would pay XXXX on an IBR plan. All I had to do was pay a {$5.00} fee to place the loan back on the payment plan. They said I should allow 3 weeks for them to "" process '' my plan, even though they literally had every piece of information in front of them. 

On XXXX XXXX I received a letter informing me they were missing documentation of my income, which makes no sense, because the woman over the phone was able to tell me my income 4 days earlier. when I called Fedloan services they tell me I need to fill out a paper application for the IBR plan, and submit paper copies of my income verification which directly contradicts everything they told the ombudsman, and everything it says on both their website and XXXX. why do they even have an app with income verification tools if you need to send a paper application as well? 

I believe this company removed me from my plan in the first place in order to threaten me with fraudulent back payments. since early XXXX I have been trying to have my IBR plan processed, which is supposed to take less than 2 weeks and it is taking over 2 months. I have had to reapply for the IBR XXXX separate times now in 2 months, and have gone onto forbearence twice and Fedloan services has instructed me at every turn to fill out another form or send something in, or wait 3 weeks for somethings to be processed. 

This entire time I have been living on an income of less than {$900.00} per month, working part time, and I can prove all of this. So I am well below the threshold for an IBR plan, and they even told me over the phone that I was eligible for {$0.00} payments. there is no excuse for them to be dragging their feet except to force me out of the IBR plan and into a plan where they can collect more money for not processing my information. 

I am still actively trying to pursue this matter with the ombudsman and Fedloan services, but I want to enter a formal complaint with the CFPB, as the behavior of my loan servicer has been dishonest and ( purposely! ) confusing, slow and incompetent to throw people like me into default so they can make more money off of fees.",,AES/PHEAA,MI,488XX,,Consent provided,Web,1/10/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2283195
6/1/2016,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Making/receiving payments, sending money",,"This complaint is regarding Wells Fargo. XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my home mortgage taking cash out to make home repairs, pay off an auto loan and pay off an installment loan with Wells Fargo. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I made the final payment on the installment loan at a local Wells Fargo branch. This check included a slight overpayment. The payment on the loan, final accrued interest and overpayment were all processed on XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 Wells Fargo reversed the entire amount paid on XXXX/XXXX/16 telling me the loan payoff was coded incorrectly. The representative on the phone told me on XXXX/XXXX/16 the loan payment was being reprocessed and should be back dated to the actual payment date. In the meantime, Wells Fargo is telling me the same installment loan is past due and put a {$39.00} late charge on the account. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called customer service to find out why the reprocessing of the loan payoff still had not gone through. I was told it was still in process. On Saturday, XXXX/XXXX/16 I went to the local branch where the original payment was made back on XXXX/XXXX/16. The personal banker called on this same installment loan and was told the payment was not made correctly. And that Wells Fargo is reprocessing the payment. This personal banker in the branch said everything was applied correctly on her end, so she felt this should be resolved and soon. Today, XXXX/XXXX/16 I contacted Wells Fargo customer service via phone again and was informed the bank check from the title company was returned for insufficient funds twice. We contacted the title company who confirmed verbally the check for the loan cleared their bank on XXXX/XXXX/16. Account numbers and check numbers were confirmed. Payments were due on this installment loan on the XXXX of each month. The loan is now XXXX days past due according to Wells Fargo. Yet I have a receipt with a transaction number proving I paid the loan IN FULL on XXXX/XXXX/16. This loan pay off was rolled into my current mortgage with Wells Fargo. So I feel they are trying to collect on the same debt twice and/or lost {$6800.00}!

Throughout the process of my daughter obtaining a loan from her financial lender, the reverse mortgage company and it 's attorneys pursued foreclosure. During the process of attempting to take over the property and without the knowledge of the estate, the reverse mortgage company made a highly unusual payment of taxes on the property.

My main problem is with the Debt Collection Company, the lesser complaint is with the school. 

I 'm currently in a dispute with my local community college regarding a small debt, either {$49.00} or {$79.00}, depending who I speak to. In XX/XX/XXXX I took XXXX XXXX XXXX classes and paid upfront with my credit card. One of the classes was canceled, and I was refunded the money for it. XX/XX/XXXX I received in the mail a small slip of paper saying in part : "" Dear XXXX, Please be advised you have a past due balance with XXXX for a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ... Pay by XX/XX/XXXX '' It did not look like a bill or invoice and my name was not on the slip or the amount owed. I called the college that day and spoke to someone who could n't tell me what class I owed for or provide any of the normal information that one would find on a bill or invoice. The woman I spoke to promised she would do research and get back to me, which never happened. 

I must point out, that I 've never been a matriculated student at this college or had a student loan. I registered and paid for XXXX XXXX classes in XX/XX/XXXX, attended XXXX, the XXXX was canceled, and the money for that class refunded. Also, the paperwork seems to indicate this "" debt '' was for something in XX/XX/XXXX, and I never registered for or attended ANY classes in XXXX. When I got the notice from the debt collector, I called the contact for the college on that notice and failed to receive any meaningful information that would indicate I owed them money. The woman was "" too busy '' to explain it other than to say that XXXX people in her department looked at the paperwork and agreed I owed them money. I responded that they should send me a proper invoice if they have such paperwork. 

At any rate, they sent this alleged debt to AR Resources Inc., and their first contact with me by mail, they sent the notice to an old address. The address is from at least 25 years ago or more. The XXXX college does not have this address on their records, so I believe AR Resources Inc deliberately used an absurdly old address so I would n't get the notice. The reason I got the notice, despite the old address, is because I still live in my home town and people in the Post Office know me and where I live currently. 

I can not stress strongly enough that AR Resources Inc had to deliberately do EXTENSIVE research to find this address. It 's not a simple clerical error. The house number they used was from the pre-XX/XX/XXXX era. Not before XX/XX/XXXX, but literally before my town had XXXX service, you know? When this address was valid, if you needed the police or ambulance, you would have had to dial the XXXX DIGIT PHONE NUMBER ON A ROTARY PHONE.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"AR Resources, Inc.",NJ,083XX,,Consent provided,Web,3/25/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1299885

7/6/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"XXXX previous case numberSince my last written complaint, Nationstar approved a HAMP but not what was originally agreed to ( Did not take off my ex husband or give me the interest rate offered by Aurora Bank ). My payment went up with this version of the HAMP but I was told my ex husband who is on the loan would be removed with this new HAMP. So, in order to get my ex husband off the loan I agreed and signed the HAMP. When I received the HAMP paperwork, I was shocked and dismayed my ex husband was still on the paperwork and I got a higher interest rate. Upon calling my rep, he explained that he would attach my divorce decree and quit claim deed where the property was quit claimed to me solely by my ex husband that this would remove his name from the loan. So, I signed and returned the paperwork regardless of the higher rate to attain this end. I attaching the email from the Nationstar rep stating that his name would be removed. I signed the paperwork with my ex husbands name on it without his signature. Nationstar signed and recorded this document ( see attached ). My ex husband served me with a lawsuit for not making payments, ruined his credit, and for not taking him off the loan. When I called Nationstar about this the said they will not remove his name off the loan, even with the paperwork I signed, the proof I sent, and the written email from their company. Now I come to find out that they fraudulently manipulated my credit report to show late payments that never occured putting my payments in a suspense account. All of my payments have been on time and I have copies of the cancelled checks to prove it so. They admitted their manipulation of the credit report however it also affected my ex husbands credit report. Their fraudulent actions not only affected me but my ex husband as well, from which I understand this is a federal offense. I am now in the XXXX year of this process. I accepted Auroras offer at 2 % and taking my ex husbands name off the loan, upon the sale of this loan to Nationstar they claim they lost the paperwork ( funny how they said they lost it but yet they accepted modified payments they said they lost XXXX. So I had to start the process all over again. I have now had to hire XXXX attorneys to try and straighten out this mess. One to defend my husbands lawsuit and the other to make Nationstar do what the said in writing. We are still going back and forth with Nationstar to do what they said.

12/8/2016,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We were recently denied a settlement counter-offer on a HELOC lien held on our property address. Please know that if we had known about the lien, we would 've continued to pay on it for the past three years. Unfortunately, we were misinformed by a USAA employee in the Bankruptcy Department on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The reason why I reached out to USAA was in order to continue making our monthly HELOC payments. The reason they had ceased is due to our filing a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy earlier in the year. Once the Bankruptcy was discharged, I reached out to USAA to continue with payments. XXXX advises that since the HELOC was n't reaffirmed, voluntary payments were no longer necessary. I also advised how originally our XXXX XXXX XXXX home mortgage/USAA HELOC was to be included in our Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy, but XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed to a Loan Modification after I filed a complaint with the US Treasury. Again, he stated that we did n't have to pay anything. He also advised we 'd no longer receive paper statements nor would we have online access to statements. In XXXX XXXX, we decided to put our house on the market in order to prepare for our XXXX son 's future. We know that he 'll be living with us for the remainder of his life. We wanted to find a house with a full basement which could eventually be modified into an in-law type suite containing a bedroom, full bathroom, kitchen, as well as a washer/dryer. This is in order for us and his XXXX to work on independent living skills in order to prepare him to become a truly independent young man. Our house sold in 4 days. In preparing the closing documents, the pre-closer advises there 's a lien from USAA on the house. She has the attorney review the bankruptcy and said that the USAA 2nd mtg was discharged in the bankruptcy BUT no lien avoidance order was filed. We need either a release from USAA ( Quitclaim deed, cancellation, etc ) to record at closing or we need a Lien Avoidance from the Bankrtupcy court. We need XXXX of these to clear title and proceed to closing. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I called USAA and after speaking with XXXX different departments, I 'm then transferred to ext. XXXX and spoke with XXXX inquiring about a lien release. She advised a lien release would occur if the balance of {$19000.00} is paid in full. I explained to her the conversation I had with the Bankruptcy Department on XXXX XXXX and she advised that she was n't involved in that conversation and did n't know what I was told. I then asked about some sort of a negotiated amount. She advised there 's a member assistance program and faxed an application. We filled out all of the documentation including a hardship letter and faxed in our request XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We receive a call from XXXX XXXX ( I 'm not certain if it 's the same XXXX who 'm I spoke with on XXXX XXXX ) stating that it seemed that we wanted to request a settlement option, not a sell short. I advised that is correct. I advised how our house is under contract and has a closing date of XXXX XXXX. She advised that USAA legally has 30 days to make a decision and as of now, our request is incomplete. She asked for a mortgage loan payoff from BAC and pay-stubs. These items were faxed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Our closing date is then moved to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We also agree to pay our buyer 's rent for the month of XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating USAA rejected our settlement offer. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I then submitted a counteroffer and that too was rejected. I spoke with XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for further clarification. She advised that since we have sufficient equity in the house to cover the lien, all counters will be rejected. The full loan amount is expected from us in order to lift the Lien.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,GA,301XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/8/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2242023

I had just completed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX. My house as well as my trustee payments were under strict compliance. I called Nationstar to resolve this issue but no one I spoke to could give me the dates of the missed payments. I spoke to a Hud councilor who referred me to the CFPB. I submitted a complaint ( case # XXXX XXXX on XXXX. Nationstar researched the problem and found XXXX payments that should have been credited to my account from their bankruptcy department. When I logged on to my account they had credited me with XXXX payments but then had taken one back out. I have since contacted the Attorney General for the state of XXXX as well as the Attorney General of XXXX. Nationstar has replied that now my missing payments were from around XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX was involved in a motion for relief during my bankruptcy. My previous mortgage co. XXXX had changed my house pymt but had not included the escrow amount. When XXXX realized the mistake they filed a motion for relief. I was instructed by my attorney to hold my house payments until the outcome of the hearing. The outcome that was settled on was for me to remit a payment of XXXX and to make XXXX additional pymts of XXXX each month beginning on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. All payments were sent to and deposited by nationstar as they had purchased my mortgage at this time. I am not behind in my mortgage payments.

Unfortunately, this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit. Otherwise, I would have an overdraft protection account and I would never incur these fees. This is not only about my funds being low, because actually my funds are n't low right now and I incurred the last XXXX overdraft notices with a positive balance! Now that 's Key Bank Magical Accounting for you! I 'm posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that I am noticing now that I am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on Key Bank to do the math. Some of my items disappear from the ledger at times. The other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly. I will be addressing these things in future complaints. This is takes an incredible amount of my time. I am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts. There is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people 's balances. I do n't even know how much I actually have in the bank now. I do n't know how to find out either. I have a ledger that I keep for my own records and it does not coincide with Key Bank 's accounting. Key Bank changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates. I have attached the overdraft notice that I received this morning XX/XX/XXXX. And I have attached the ledger from XX/XX/XXXX copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the XXXX that is credited to the account with the deposit that I made that morning. It shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description. In addition, this same deposit that was made at the ATM disappears later in the day. as does the XXXX debit. Where do they go? There is a note that says that Key Bank is working on the account and some items might not be available, but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the XXXX charge. I have gotten XXXX overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the Hassle Free account which is my son 's account. They are both my accounts. I should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts. So on XX/XX/XXXX I started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited XXXX into my account. Yet I bounced XXXX items, though I was only charged for XXXX. this is very unclear unprofessional accounting. If I did not have direct deposits coming into this account, I would close it. And the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business. They do not care about their customers as evidenced by the fact that I have spent a lot of time this week complaining because of their over draft practices and they keep overdrafting me even with a positive balance. Get it together Key Bank. Adding and Subtracting are basic math skills that you should have. Stop reordering items to benefit yourselves. Give people a break. Last month you bounced XXXX debit transactions of mine that came all together to a little over XXXX You made almost XXXX $ off of those transactions.",,KEYCORP,NY,138XX,,Consent provided,Web,11/21/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1666956

4/27/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"In XXXX of XXXX I bought a new car. The dealer told me that I would be contacted by Citizen One ( then RBS Citizens ) about the exact amount of each monthly payment and about the exact date each payment would be due. Sometime shortly after that Citizen One sent me my first monthly billing statement. For the next 2 1/2 years Citizen One set a precedent and created an expectation by regularly sending me monthly billing statements. During that time I faithfully made each payment on time and, on several occasions, made monthly payments for several months in advance. For these reasons I relied on receiving my monthly billing statement from Citizen One to know the exact amount of and the exact due date of my next loan installment. In XXXX XXXX Citizen One suddenly and unexpectedly stopped sending me billing statements. I did n't notice ( I had been habituated by their monthly notices and I had been trained to think of sending a payment only after I was notified ) and, as a direct result of Citizen One 's failure to send a monthly billing statement, I was late with my XXXX payment. When their credit department contacted me I sent 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and notified them that I had n't received a statement. Their customer service representative told me that I should have received a monthly billing statement, it was Citizen One 's policy to do so, verified my contact information ( which had n't changed ) and, under the circumstances, waived the {$20.00} fee I had been assessed for being late. She also assured me that I would start to receive monthly billing statements again. Unfortunately, I did not. Nor did I notice. As a result of that failure on the part of Citizen One I was again contacted in XXXX by their credit department that I was late again. I immediately made 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and pled with their customer service department to please get a monthly billing statement to me. Mail it, fax it, e-mail it - I did n't care. Just get one to me. This time they promised to mail me a paper statement and e-mail me my reminders. To date I have n't received either. As a result I was late again in XXXX. I am not accusing Citizen One of intentionally withholding my monthly billing statements but I find it very suspicious that all of my other mail is delivered without incident. I am never - and I do mean never - late with any of my other bills. I also find it convenient ( and profitable ) that Citizen One gains from their own failure! They are now refusing to waive XXXX {$20.00} late fees. Something is very wrong on their end and it is entirely unfair that I am being penalized for not being sent a monthly billing statement which serves as notification that a loan payment in a specific amount is due. Furthermore, I should not be charged {$20.00} fees when my payment is late as a result of neglect or failure on Citizen One 's part to send me a monthly billing statement. I suspect that I am not the only customer of Citizen One with this problem. I have made exhaustive efforts to remedy this issue with the bank but they are intransigent and so I am filing this compliant to get this situation resolved and, on the principles of being fair and taking responsibility for their part in creating this problem, get the outstanding late fees waived and ensure delivery of a monthly billing statement.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",IN,460XX,,Consent provided,Web,4/29/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1898052

I have to contact customer service by phone in order to make changes or discuss my account. My complaint is about the customer service representatives. They are not professional and totally incompetent. I requested to have my automatic payment reduced from {$250.00} per mo. 
to {$120.00} and 3 different representatives assured me ( including a supervisor ) that the change was made but it was not. Since I can not manage my account online I have no recourse but to rely on customer service reps.

9/11/2016,Credit card,,Unsolicited issuance of credit card,,"I had gone into a Wells Fargo bank when I lived in XXXX XXXX California because I lost my Debit card, the teller had me meet with one of the managers at his desk, and they tried to talk me into a college credit card I told him I did n't want another credit card and no thank you I just needed a replacement debit card. Two weeks later I received a credit card and a debit card in the mail. I was so aggravated I worked XXXX jobs and was taking XXXX units in college I did n't have time to go to the bank or to sit on the phone right away to cancel the card. Within a couple of weeks I had a small overdraft and it went strait onto the credit card and at that point I knew this was going to show up on my credit report and I was trying to keep my revolving credit low. Since then I have been trying to pay this card off and close the account but it has cause me to have late payments and has just been a devstaing to my creidt and has blocked me from buying the home of my dreams.This card has been nothing but a headache affecting my ability to get a home, and a new car with a good rate this has been haunting me for a little while now. I had gone into the bank since then and told the teller and she stated I would have to call the bank. I was so shocked that someone could do this and they do n't even want to fire the guy, he was there at work that day I went in and pointed him out to the teller and all she said was to call.

8/31/2016,Bank account or service,Savings account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a letter to close my account with Ally Bank. XX/XX/XXXX, having not yet received a check, I called to understand status on XXXX XXXX, 2016. They said they mailed the check and would need to reissue a new check. Given the amount ( over {$190000.00} ), I asked them to expedite whatever paperwork was necessary. On XXXX XXXX, I had still not received any paperwork, so again called. They said they had not done anything as a result of my original request, but would send paperwork via email. Since I was traveling, I did not have access to a printer and the paperwork "" expired '' after 8 hours. The access to the paperwork was laborious at best as it was sent through a secured site. On XXXX XXXX, I called Ally Bank again ( spend another 30 minutes on the phone ) and they again indicated they would send out paperwork which would need to be notarized. They also indicated they had not yet cancelled the check. A few questions : 1 ) Why did they not immediately cancel the check on XXXX XXXX when I originally notifified them the check had been lost? 
2 ) Why did they not send out the paperwork after the XXXX XXXX call? 
3 ) Why does the paperwork expire after 8 hours so the consumer can not get access to their funds. Since I was traveling, this delayed me yet another 2 weeks? 
4 ) Why does the paperwork have to be notarized and why does it have to be sent through a secured site. On XXXX XXXX, the check had not been cashed, so I do not understand why this level of difficulty in getting access to my funds. 
5 ) Are they making the process inordinately difficult in order to keep my funds, in hopes XXXX XXXX not be relentless enough to spend hours on the phone, find a notary, decode a difficult and confusing software to access the paperwork and hope that they expedite my check and actually deliver it this time. 
I work in financial services, and take the CFPB very seriously. I have never made a complaint, but this situation has been so aggregious and so consumer unfriendly, I thought it important to bring it to your attention. I would appreciate any help you can give me to expedite this matter to a close for me and as importantly to provide Ally guidance on how to treat consumers in the future.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,ALLY FINANCIAL INC.,TX,787XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/31/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2090442
